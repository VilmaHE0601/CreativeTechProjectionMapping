# Projection Mapping: Cyber Ocean
Cyber Ocean is an innovative visual arts project that creates a unique digital ocean environment through the use of TouchDesigner, a visual compositing tool. The project allows users to import their own videos into a dynamically generated digital world, making the experience unique to each individual.

## Concept and Technology
Users can import one or more videos with a resolution less than or equal to 1280x1280 at will, and utilize the projector to project them in the 3D space, thus creating and immersing themselves in their own personal Cyber Ocean.

### Input Signal
The video will be used as the Input signal for this project, and incoming electrical signals or data in the system or device will be used to trigger and activate the project.

### Data Processing
Synthesis: Using the extracted data, a generative system within TouchDesigner uses various operators (TOPs, CHOPs, SOPs) to create visual elements. These elements might mimic oceanic attributes such as waves, ripples, and reflections, which change dynamically based on the video input.
Real-time Feedback: The system often includes real-time feedback loops where the output visuals are fed back into the system as inputs to create complex, evolving patterns.

## Experienments
Test and adjust the projector and space to select the best resolution, position, brightness and size for the project.
I chose a three-sided space for the video projection so that the video adapts perfectly to the changing shape of the space. Although the three walls displayed the same video, different clips were played. In the end, I decided to project on the walls of the studio, as viewing the ocean often brings us comfort in times of stress, allowing us to feel relaxed and release stress. In the studio, the user's personal video is transformed into a "Cyber Ocean" so that when the stress of studying becomes too much to bear, one can always immerse oneself in the digital ocean of one's own memories.
